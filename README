== PURPOSE ==

This package, initially a collection of Michael Covington's private macros, provides
numerous minor LaTeX enhancements for linguistics, including multiple accents on the
same letter, interlinear glosses (word-by-word translations), Discourse Represenation
Structures, and example numbering.

The package works both with LaTeX 2.09 and LaTeX 2e.

== CONTENTS ==

The package consists of the following files:

* covington.sty: the actual package
* covington.tex: the documentation
* README (this file)

== CHANGES ==

* Version 1.4 (2017-05-22):

	- Introduce a new macro \twodias that supersedes the rather odd \twoacc
	  (which is kept for backwards compatibility).

	- Introduce macro \SetDiaOffset for more convenient setting of vertical
	  distance in stacked diacritics.

	- LaTeX 2.09 is no longer officially supported (it might continue to work,
	  but is not tested).

* Version 1.3 (2017-04-05):

        - Gloss variants \xgll and \xglll that work inside macros (such as footnotes)
          but require explicit gloss line end markers (\xgle).

	- Provide way to globally alter indentation and vertical distance of reflists
          (new lengths \reflistindent, \reflistparsep and \reflistitemsep).

* Version 1.2 (2016-08-26):

	- New length \examplenumbersep to adjust (increase) the horizontal space
	  between example number and example text.
	
	- Add some more info about bibliography generation.

* Version 1.1a (2016-07-07):

	- Fix encoding problem in documentation and some typos. No change in functionality.

* Version 1.1 (2016-07-06):

	- The package now uses NFSS font commands if available (fallback for LaTeX 2.09
	  is still provided).

	- Work around clash with classes/packages that define their own example and
	  examples environments (most notably the beamer class) as well as execise
	  environments. The covington package no longer blindly attempts to define
	  these environments. By default, it does not define them if they are already
	  defined (covington's own environments, however, are still available via aliases).
	  By means of a new package option, a redefinition can also be forced.

	- New length \twoaccsep allows for the adjustment of the distance between stacked
	  accents.

	- Update manual.

	- New maintainer: J. Spitzmueller.

	- License has been changed to LPPL (in agreement with M. Covington).

	- Introduce version numbers. Arbitrarily, we start with 1.1.
