== PURPOSE ==

This package, initially a collection of Michael Covington's private macros, provides
numer­ous mi­nor LATEX en­hance­ments for lin­guis­tics, in­clud­ing mul­ti­ple ac­cents on the
same let­ter, in­ter­line glosses (word-by-word trans­la­tions), Dis­course Rep­re­sen­ta­tion
Struc­tures, and ex­am­ple num­ber­ing.

The package works both with LaTeX 2.09 and LaTeX2e.


== CONTENTS ==

The package consists of the following files:

* covington.sty: the actual package
* covington.tex: the documentation
* README (this file)

== CHANGES ==

* Version 1.1 (2016-07-06):

	- The package now uses NFSS font commands if available (fallback for LaTeX 2.09
	  is still provided).

	- Work around clash with classes/packages that define their own example and
	  examples environments (most notably the beamer class) as well as execise
	  environments. The covington package no longer blindly attempts to define
	  these environments. By default, it does not define them if they are already
	  defined (covington's own environments, however, are still available via aliases).
	  By means of a new package option, a redefinition can also be forced.

	- New length \twoaccsep allows for the adjustment of the distance between stacked
	  accents.

	- Update manual.

	- New maintainer: J. Spitzmüller.

	- License has been changed to LPPL (in agreement with M. Covington).

	- Introduce version numbers. Arbitrarily, we start with 1.1.
