\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

This is the documentation for \MakeLowercase{\pversion}
of \cvt\ (\pdate), which is a \LaTeX\ package providing macros
for typing some special notations common in linguistics.%
\footnote{The package has a long history. It started off as a collection of private macros back in the
\LaTeX\ 2.09 days and was initially released as \texttt{covingtn.sty} (following the old 8.3 \textsc{fat}
file name limit). In em\TeX\ under \textsc{ms-dos}, the file was distributed as \texttt{covingto.sty}.
Eventually, it has been renamed to \cvt\ and adapted to \LaTeXe.}

To use \cvt\ with \LaTeXe, load the package as usual by adding the command
\lstinline"\usepackage{covington}" to your document preamble.
The package has the following options:
\begin{description}
	\item{\joption{force}:} Force the redefinition of environments that have already been
	defined by other packages or the class.
	
	This applies to the \jenv{example}, \jenv{examples}, \jenv{subexamples} and \jenv{exercise} environments,
	which are by default not touched if they are already defined before \cvt\ is loaded.
	See sec.~\ref{sec:ex}, \ref{sec:exs}, \ref{sec:subexs} and \ref{sec:exercises} for details.
	
	\item{\joption{keeplayout}:} Do not tweak the layout.
	
	\Cvt\ sets \jfcsmacro{raggedbottom} and redefines the value of the \jfcsmacro{textfloatsep} length.
	This just follows the preferences of the original package author and is not necessary
	for the package's functionality. Yet for backwards compatibility reasons, we cannot change this.
	Thus, we provide the option described here to opt out this presetting.

\item{\joption{noglossbreaks}:} If this option is set, \cvt\ will try hard to prevent page breaks within glosses.

	If this option is not set, page breaks can occur between interlinearized text and free translation of a gloss, as
	well as between gloss preamble and interlinearized text, which is usually not what you will want.
	Nonetheless the option is not set by default. This is for backwards compatibility reasons (in order to not change
	page breaking of existing documents). Note that page breaks might still occur in some cases even if the option is set.
	In order to prevent them definitely, you can put the gloss in a parbox or minipage.
	
\item{\joption{owncounter}:} Use an own counter for numbered examples.

	By default, \cvt\ uses \LaTeX's equation counter for example numbering, so that if you use equations and numbered examples
	in the same	paper, you get a single continuous series of numbers. While some people (including the original author of this package)
	consider this a feature, others might prefer to number equations and linguistic examples separately. If you count to the latter sort,
	use this option.
\end{description}
%
Please note the following package-related caveats:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If you are using \cvt\ and the \textsf{uga} (University of Georgia thesis style) package together, you should load \textsf{uga} before \cvt.
	\item If you are using \cvt\ with \textsf{beamer-article}, you should load \textsf{beamer-article} before \cvt.
\end{itemize}
%
In what follows we presume that you know how to use \LaTeX\ and have 
access to \LaTeX\ manuals.

\section{Stacked diacritics}\label{sec:accents}

\LaTeX\ provides a generous range of diacritics that can be placed on or below any
letter, such as:
\begin{flushleft}
\`{x} \'{x} \^{x} \"{x} \~{x} \={x} \H{x} \t{xx} \c{x} \d{x} \b{x}
\end{flushleft}
which are typed, respectively, as:
\begin{lstlisting}
\`{x} \'{x} \^{x} \"{x} \~{x} \={x} \H{x} \t{xx} \c{x} \d{x} \b{x}
\end{lstlisting}
Out of the box, however, \LaTeX\ doesn't give you a convenient way to put \emph{two}
diacritical marks on the same letter.  To fill this gap, \cvt\ provides
the following macros:
\begin{flushleft}
	\jcsmacro{twodias\{<upper diac.>\}\{<lower diac.>\}\{<char>\}}\\to combine any two diacritics, e.\,g.,
	               \lstinline[moretexcs={twodias}].\twodias{\~}{\=}{a}. = \twodias{\~}{\=}{a}\\[6pt]
	\jcsmacro{acm\{\ldots\}} \quad for acute over macron, e.\,g., \lstinline[moretexcs={acm}].\acm{a}. = \acm{a}\\
	\jcsmacro{grm\{\ldots\}} \quad for grave over macron, e.\,g., \lstinline[moretexcs={grm}].\grm{a}. = \grm{a}\\
	\jcsmacro{cim\{\ldots\}} \quad for circumflex over macron, e.\,g., \lstinline[moretexcs={cim}].\cim{a}. = \cim{a}
\end{flushleft}
The first of these is the general case\footnote{%
	Alternatively, there's also the old syntax \jcsmacro{twoacc[<upper diac.>|<char with lower diacr.>],}
	e.\,g. \jfcsmacro{twoacc[\textbackslash\textasciitilde|\textbackslash=\{a\}]} to the same effect, which is however discouraged
	due to its rather odd form.} and the latter three are special
cases that are often used in Greek transcription. Now you can type
\emph{Koin\acm{e}} with both accents in place.

The vertical distance between the two diacritics can be adjusted via the macro \jcsmacro{SetDiaOffset\{<length>\}}
which lets you increase or decrease the vertical space that is currently in effect.
If you'd use \verb"\SetDiaOffset{-0.25ex}", the above examples would come out as

\SetDiaOffset{-.25ex}
\begin{flushleft}
	\jcsmacro{twodias\{<upper diac.>\}\{<lower diac.>\}\{<char>\}}\\to combine any two diacritics, e.\,g.,
	\lstinline[moretexcs={twodias}].\twodias{\~}{\=}{a}. = \twodias{\~}{\=}{a}\\[6pt]
	\jcsmacro{acm\{\ldots\}} \quad for acute over macron, e.\,g., \lstinline[moretexcs={acm}].\acm{a}. = \acm{a}\\
	\jcsmacro{grm\{\ldots\}} \quad for grave over macron, e.\,g., \lstinline[moretexcs={grm}].\grm{a}. = \grm{a}\\
	\jcsmacro{cim\{\ldots\}} \quad for circumflex over macron, e.\,g., \lstinline[moretexcs={cim}].\cim{a}. = \cim{a}
\end{flushleft}
with a slightly better matching distance for the font used here.

Note that not all accent macros work in the \jfenv{tabbing} environment.
Use the \jfenv{Tabbing} package or refer to \cite{pakin} for alternative solutions.


\section{Numbered examples}

Linguistic papers often include numbered examples. With \cvt, generating those is straightforward.
In this section, we describe how you can typeset a self-stepping example number (see section~\ref{sec:exno}),
a single numbered example (sec.~\ref{sec:ex}), a consecutive range of numbered examples (sec.~\ref{sec:exs}),
and alpha-numerically labeled sub-examples (sec.~\ref{sec:subexs}).
All numbered examples can be referred to in the text via \jfcsmacro{label} and \jfcsmacro{ref} as usual
(see sec.~\ref{sec:ref} for details).

\subsection{Example numbers}\label{sec:exno}

The macro \jcsmacro{exampleno} generates a new example number, stepped by 1. It can be 
used anywhere you want the number to appear.  For example, to display a 
sentence with a number at the extreme right, do this:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={exampleno}]
\begin{flushleft}
This is a sentence. \hfill (\exampleno)
\end{flushleft}
\end{lstlisting}
Here's what you get:
\begin{flushleft}
This is a sentence. \hfill (\exampleno)
\end{flushleft}
If you want to output the number without stepping it, the starred form \jcsmacro{exampleno*} will do that. 

Normally, however, you do not need to manually place \jcsmacro{exampleno} yourselves,
as in the example above. For the common case where example numbers in parentheses are
placed left to the example, \cvt\ provides more convenient solutions. These are described in turn.


\subsection[The \texttt{example} environment]{The \jenv{example} environment}\label{sec:ex}

The \jenv{example} environment (alias \jenv{covexample}) displays a single example
with a generated example number to the left of it.
If you type
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{example}
This is a sentence.
\end{example}
\end{lstlisting}
or
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{covexample}
This is a sentence.
\end{covexample}
\end{lstlisting}
you get:
\begin{example}
This is a sentence.\label{expl}
\end{example}
The example can be of any length; it can consist of many lines (separated by \verb"\\"), or even whole paragraphs.

If you need more space between the example number and the text, you can increase it by means of
the length \jcsmacro{examplenumbersep} (which is preset to \texttt{0pt}). Doing \lstinline|\setlength\examplenumbersep{1em}|,
for instance, will increase the space by 1\,em (negative values will decrease the space accordingly).

Note that, as of version 1.1, \cvt\ checks if there is already an \jenv{example} environment defined
(e.\,g., by the class). If so, \cvt\ does not
define its own one. However, there is always the alias environment \jenv{covexample} which can be used in order to
produce \texttt{covington's} example. If you use the package option \joption{force}, \cvt\ will override
existing \jenv{example} environments. In any case, the package will issue a warning if \jenv{example} is already defined
(this is the case, for instance, if you use \cvt\ with the \texttt{beamer} class).

One way to number sub-examples is to use \jfenv{itemize} or \jfenv{enumerate}
within an example, like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{example}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] This is the first sentence.
\item[(b)] This is the second sentence.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}
\end{lstlisting}
This prints as:
\begin{example}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] This is the first sentence.
\item[(b)] This is the second sentence.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}
However, the \jenv{examples} and \jenv{subexamples} environments, described in turn, are usually more 
convenient for this task.

\subsection[The \texttt{examples} environment]{The \jenv{examples} environment}\label{sec:exs}

To display a series of examples together, each with its own example 
number, use \jenv{examples} (or \jenv{covexamples}) instead of \jenv{example} or \jenv{covexample}.  The only 
difference is that there can be more than one example, and each of them 
has to be introduced by \jfcsmacro{item}, like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{examples}
\item This is the first sentence.
\item This is the second sentence.
\end{examples}
\end{lstlisting}
or, respectively:
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{covexamples}
\item This is the first sentence.
\item This is the second sentence.
\end{covexamples}
\end{lstlisting}
This prints as:
\begin{examples}
\item This is the first sentence.
\item This is the second sentence.
\end{examples}
As for \jenv{example}, \cvt\ checks if there is already an \jenv{examples} environment defined,
and if this is the case, \cvt\ does not define its own one. The alias environment \jenv{covexamples}
is always available as a fallback. If you use the package option \joption{force}, \cvt\ will override
existing \jenv{examples} environments. The package will issue a warning if \jenv{examples} is already defined
(this is the case, for instance, if you use \cvt\ with the \texttt{beamer} class), telling you
how it has dealt with the situation.


\subsection[The \texttt{subexamples} environment]{The \jenv{subexamples} environment}\label{sec:subexs}

Sometimes a set of (paradigmatic) sub-examples gets only one main example number with alphabetic sub-numbering,
as in \pxref{sbex}. To achieve this most conveniently, \cvt\ provides the \jenv{subexamples} (or \jenv{covsubexamples})
environment.  The difference to \jenv{examples}\slash \jenv{covexamples} is the numbering:
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{subexamples}
\item This is the first sentence.
\item This is the second sentence.
\end{subexamples}
\end{lstlisting}
or, respectively:
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{covsubexamples}
\item This is the first sentence.
\item This is the second sentence.
\end{covsubexamples}
\end{lstlisting}
prints as:
\begin{subexamples}
	\item This is the first sentence.\label{sbex}
	\item This is the second sentence.
\end{subexamples}
%
Again, \cvt\ checks if there is already an \jenv{subexamples} environment defined,
and if this is the case, \cvt\ does not define its own one. The alias environment \jenv{covsubexamples}
is always available as a fallback. If you use the package option \joption{force}, \cvt\ will override
existing \jenv{subexamples} environments. The package will issue a warning if \jenv{subexamples} is already defined.

\medskip
\noindent The \jenv{subexamples} environment provides the following option:
\begin{description}
	\item[\joption{preamble=\{\jparam{arbitrary text}\}}] Arbitrary text that is inserted in the first line
	(after the main number and before the first sub-example, which then follows in a new line).
	This might be useful, for instance, to give context information, to specify the language or the source
	in case of cited sub-examples. You can globally set the markup of this preamble	text (see sec.~\ref{sec:custno}).
\end{description}
%
For instance,
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{subexamples}[preamble={Here are two sentences}]
\item This is the first sentence.
\item This is the second sentence.
\end{subexamples}
\end{lstlisting}
or, respectively:
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{covsubexamples}[preamble={Here are two sentences}]
\item This is the first sentence.
\item This is the second sentence.
\end{covsubexamples}
\end{lstlisting}
prints as:
\begin{subexamples}[preamble={Here are two sentences}]
	\item This is the first sentence.
	\item This is the second sentence.
\end{subexamples}


\subsection{Customizing numbering and markup}\label{sec:custno}

You can change the display of the example number by redefining (via \jfcsmacro{renewcommand*}) the macro
\jcsmacro{covexnumber} which has the following default definition:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={covexnumber}]
\newcommand*\covexnumber[1]{(#1)}
\end{lstlisting}

In the same vein, you can customize the display of the subexample letter by redefining (also via \jfcsmacro{renewcommand*})
the macro \jcsmacro{covsubexnumber} which has the following default definition:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={covsubexnumber}]
\newcommand*\covsubexnumber[1]{(#1)}
\end{lstlisting}

The distance between example number and subnumber (letter) can be changed via the length \jcsmacro{examplenumbersep}
(which is preset to \texttt{0pt}). The distance between example subnumber and text can be changed  via the length
\jcsmacro{subexamplenumbersep} (preset to \texttt{0pt} as well). In both cases, a positive value will increase, a negative
value will decrease the respective distance.
Doing 
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={setlength,examplenumbersep,subexamplenumbersep}]
\setlength{\examplenumbersep}{-0.5em}
\setlength{\subexamplenumbersep}{0.5em}
\end{lstlisting}
for instance, will come out like this:

\bgroup
\setlength{\examplenumbersep}{-0.5em}
\setlength{\subexamplenumbersep}{0.5em}

\begin{subexamples}
	\item This is the first sentence.
	\item This is the second sentence.
\end{subexamples}
\egroup
%
\noindent You can also customize the markup of the example sentences by redefining the macro
\jcsmacro{covexamplefs} (which is empty by default). To have all example sentences italicized, for instance, do this:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={covexamplefs}]
\renewcommand*{\covexamplefs}{\itshape}
\end{lstlisting}
%
Note that this does, deliberately, not include the numbers, since those are controlled by another font setting macro,
\jcsmacro{covexamplenofs}, which defaults to \jfcsmacro{normalfont}. Of course you are free to redefine this as well,
if you wish do to so.

Finally, you can customize the markup of the sub-example preamble text by redefining the macro
\jcsmacro{subexpreamblefs}, which also defaults to \jfcsmacro{normalfont}. To have it italicized, do:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={\subexpreamblefs}]
\renewcommand*{\subexpreamblefs}{\itshape}
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Referring to examples}\label{sec:ref}

References to examples and sub-examples can be made the usual way via the \jcsmacro{ref} command
(which refers to a \jcsmacro{label} that is placed in the respective example paragraph).
The references do not have parentheses by default, i.\,e., a reference to the example
in section~\ref{sec:ex} would be printed as \ref{expl}, a reference to the sub-example
in section~\ref{sec:subexs} as \ref{sbex}.
For convenience, though, \cvt\ provides a command \jcsmacro{pxref} that also prints the parentheses,
as in \pxref{expl} and \pxref{sbex}. It is defined as follows and can be redefined if needed:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={providecommand,pxref}]
\providecommand*\pxref[1]{(\ref{#1})}
\end{lstlisting}


\section{Glossing sentences word-by-word}\label{sec:gloss}

To gloss a sentence is to annotate it word-by-word.  Most commonly, a 
sentence in a foreign language is followed by a word-for-word 
translation (with the words lined up vertically) and then a smooth 
translation (not lined up), like this:
\digloss{Dit is een Nederlands voorbeeld}
        {This is a Dutch example}
        {This is an example in Dutch.}
\Cvt\ provides different ways to typeset such glosses. The most convenient
way is via gloss macros (see sec.~\ref{sec:gmacros}), an alternative (and the
traditional) way is via a set of commands (see sec.~\ref{sec:glosscmds}).
Both are described in turn.

\subsection{Gloss macros}\label{sec:gmacros}

\Cvt\ provides two gloss macros:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \jcsmacro{digloss[\jparam{options}]\{\jparam{gloss line 1}\}\{\jparam{gloss line 2}\}\{\jparam{free translation}\}}\\
	       typesets two-line glosses with a translation line (the macro name
	       puns on Greek \lexp{diglossía}, lit. \lmean{two tongues}, \lmean{bilingualism})
	\item \jcsmacro{trigloss[\jparam{options}]\{\jparam{gloss l.\,1}\}\{\jparam{gloss l.\,2}\}\{\jparam{gloss l.\,3}\}\{\jparam{free tr.}\}}\\
	       typesets three-line\footnote{The additional line can be useful for instance
	       to gloss cited forms, morphology, or an additional translation.
	       See sec.~\ref{sec:glossex} for examples.}
       	   glosses with a translation line (cf. Greek \lexp{triglossía},
       	   lit. \lmean{three tongues}, \lmean{trilingualism})
\end{itemize}
%
The example given above would thus be typed as:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={digloss}]
\digloss{Dit is een Nederlands voorbeeld}
        {This is a Dutch example}
        {This is an example in Dutch.}
\end{lstlisting}
%
Note that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The \jparam{free translation} argument can be left empty. In this case, no translation line is added
	      (and no extra space taken).
	\item The macros automatically markup the lines. By default, the first gloss
          line is in italics, subsequent lines are set upright, and the free translation in single
          quotation marks (using the language-sensitive \textsf{csquotes} \cite{csquotes} macros if
          this package is loaded). This can be customized, though, via the macro options or globally
          (for the latter, see sec.~\ref{sec:glossfc}).
    \item By default, page breaks might occur within glosses. In order to prevent it, the option
          \joption{noglossbreaks} (see sec.~\ref{sec:intro}) will help in many cases.
          If it doesn't, you can wrap the whole gloss into a minipage or parbox.
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\noindent The following \joption{\jparam{options}} (key-value pairs) are provided for either macro:

\begin{description}
	\item[\joption{ex=\jparam{true|false}}] Default: \emph{false}. Wraps the gloss in an example environment
	      (i.\,e., it is numberered).
	\item[\joption{tlr=\jparam{true|false}}] Default: \emph{false}. If set to true, the translation line (content
          of the \jparam{free translation} argument) is set right to the gloss lines, rather than into a new line below.
          Since the gloss itself is set in a box, this means the \jparam{free translation} will appear lined up with the
          first line of the gloss. This can be useful when no translation, but an aligned number or something similar,
          is to be inserted right to the gloss (please refer to sec.~\ref{sec:glossex} for an example).
	\item[\joption{fsi=\{\jparam{font settings}\}}] Adjusts the font settings of the first gloss line.
	        Valid values are \LaTeX\ font switches such as \jfcsmacro{itshape}, \jfcsmacro{bfseries} etc.
	\item[\joption{fsii=\{\jparam{font settings}\}}] Adjusts the font settings of the second gloss line.
	        Valid values are \LaTeX\ font switches such as \jfcsmacro{itshape}, \jfcsmacro{bfseries} etc.
	\item[\joption{fsiii=\{\jparam{font settings}\}}] Adjusts the font settings of the third gloss line.
	        Valid values are \LaTeX\ font switches such as \jfcsmacro{itshape}, \jfcsmacro{bfseries} etc.
	\item[\joption{preamble=\{\jparam{arbitrary text}\}}] Arbitrary text that is inserted on an own line
	     before the interlinearized gloss. This might be useful, for instance, to give context information,
	     to specify the language or the source in case of cited glosses. The advantages over just adding a
	     line manually above the gloss are that you can globally set the markup (see sec.~\ref{sec:glossfc})
	     and that such lines are kept on the same page than the gloss with the option \joption{noglossbreaks}
	     (at least as long as preamble does not exceed one line).
\end{description}
%
If given as the argument to a \jcsmacro{digloss} or \jcsmacro{trigloss} macro, the options will only apply to
this very gloss. If you want to make a permanent change, you can use the macro
\begin{itemize}
	\item \jcsmacro{setglossoptions\{\jparam{options}\}}
\end{itemize}
and pass either of the above options to it. This will apply to all subsequent glosses (until further global
change and unless the setting is altered locally via macro option).

Notice, finally, that the words do not have to be typed lining up; instead, \TeX\ 
counts them.  If the words in the two languages do not correspond 
one-to-one, you can use curly brackets to group words.
For example, to print
\digloss{Dit  is een voorbeeldje      in het Nederlands}
        {This is a   {little example} in {}  Dutch}
        {This is a little example in Dutch.}
you would type:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={digloss}]

\subsection{Glossing with low-level commands}\label{sec:glosscmds}

The gloss macros described above build on low-level commands\footnote{The commands are adapted
with permission from \texttt{gloss.tex}, by Marcel R. van der Goot.} which can also
be used directly (this was actually the only way up to \cvt\ 2.0 which introduced the macros).
Low-level commands can be useful if you want to do fancy things in a gloss.
Note, though, that using them also has limitations:
Some commands cannot be used inside macros (such as footnotes), and the markup is not done automatically
in all cases (as documented in what follows); furthermore, you cannot make use of the options the macros have.
Thus, we strongly suggest to use the macros,
unless you have very good reasons not to do that.

The following is a complete list of all low-level glossing commands:
\begin{description}\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
	\item[\jcsmacro{gll}] introduces two lines of words vertically aligned, and 
	      activates an environment very similar to \jfenv{flushleft}.
	      The two lines are separated by a normal line break (carriage return).
	      This is possible since the command makes the line-ending character active.
	      As a consequence, however, this command does not work inside macros
	      (such as \jfcsmacro{footnote}).
	\item[\jcsmacro{glll}] is like \jcsmacro{gll} except that it introduces
	      \emph{three} lines of lined-up words.
	\item[\jcsmacro{xgll}] is similar to \jcsmacro{gll} except that it does not make
	       the line ending active. It thus works inside macros such as footnotes but
	       requires explicit gloss line termination via \jcsmacro{xgle}.
	\item[\jcsmacro{xglll}] is similar to \jcsmacro{glll} except that it does not make
	      the line ending active. It thus works inside macros such as footnotes but
	      requires explicit gloss line termination via \jcsmacro{xgle}.
	\item[\jcsmacro{xgle}] is a gloss line ending marker to be used with \jcsmacro{xgll}
	      and \jcsmacro{xglll}.
	\item[\jcsmacro{glt}] ends the set of lined-up lines and introduces a line 
	      (or more) of translation. Note that this command does not markup the translation
	      line (no automatic enquoting). Also, it outputs an empty line if no text follows.
	\item[\jcsmacro{gln}] is like \jcsmacro{glt} but does not start a new line 
	      (useful when no translation follows but you want to put a number on the 
	       right).
	\item[\jcsmacro{glot\{\jparam{free translation}\}}] is an alternative to \jcsmacro{glt}
	     and a smarter way to insert a translation line. Other than \jcsmacro{glt}, it marks up
	     (by default: enquotes) the translation line. Also, it does not add an empty line if the
	     translation is empty. This command has been introduced in \cvt\ 2.0.
	\item[\jcsmacro{glosspreamble\{\jparam{arbitrary text}\}}] lets you enter text that is printed immediately
	     before the interlinearized gloss (on a line of its own). This might be useful, for instance,
	     to give context information, to specify the language or the source in case of cited glosses.
	     The advantages over just adding a line manually above the gloss are that you can globally set the markup
	     (see sec.~\ref{sec:glossfc})   and that such lines are kept on the same page than the gloss with the option
	     \joption{noglossbreaks}. Note, however, that page breaks might occur if this text spans multiple lines.
	     In this case, you can wrap the whole gloss into a minipage.
	     This command has been introduced in \cvt\ 2.1.
	\item[\jcsmacro{glend}] ends the special \jfenv{flushleft}-like environment.
\end{description}
%
Using the low-level commands, the examples given above would be
coded as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={gll,glt,glend}]
\gll Dit is een Nederlands voorbeeld. 
     This is a Dutch example. 
\glt `This is an example in Dutch.'
\glend
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={gll,glt,glend}]
\gll Dit is een voorbeeldje     in het Nederlands
     This is a {little example} in {}  Dutch
\glt `This is a little example in Dutch.'
\glend
\end{lstlisting}
%
Observe that you need to markup (i.\,e., enquote) the translation line yourself if you use \jcsmacro{glt}.
This is not so if you use \jcsmacro{glot}:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={gll,glot,glend}]
\gll Dit is een Nederlands voorbeeld
     This is a Dutch example
\glot{This is an example in Dutch.}
\glend
\end{lstlisting}
%
The advantage of \jcsmacro{glot} is that you can easily customize the translation markup globally.
Also, \jcsmacro{glot} uses the language-sensitive \textsf{csquotes} \cite{csquotes} macros if
this package is loaded (see sec.~\ref{sec:glossfc}).

Since \jcsmacro{gll} and \jcsmacro{glll} locally activate the end of line in glosses in order to
identify the different lines of the gloss (via category code change), they do not work inside macros
(e.\,g., if the gloss is in a footnote). To work around this, special versions of the \jcsmacro{gll}
and \jcsmacro{glll} commands are provided that do without the character activation: \jcsmacro{xgll}
and \jcsmacro{xglll}, respectively.
These can also be used in macro arguments; however, the end of each gloss line needs to be explicitly
specified by the \jcsmacro{xgle} command in this case.
If you want to put the above gloss in a footnote, thus, you would type:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={xgll,xgle,glt,glend}]
\xgll Dit is een voorbeeldje     in het Nederlands.\xgle
      This is a {little example} in {}  Dutch.\xgle
\glt `This is a little example in Dutch.'
\glend
\end{lstlisting}
%
Note, again, that the macros described in sec.~\ref{sec:gmacros} do not have this problem.

To sum up: With low-level commands, every glossed sentence begins with either \jcsmacro{gll},
\jcsmacro{xgll}, \jcsmacro{glll} or \jcsmacro{xglll}, then contains either \jcsmacro{glt} or
\jcsmacro{gln}, and ends with \jcsmacro{glend}.
Layout is critical in the part preceding \jcsmacro{glt} or \jcsmacro{gln}, and fairly free afterward.


\subsection{Customization}\label{sec:glossfc}

The font settings of each gloss line can be customized globally by way of
the global options macro \jcsmacro{setglossoptions} and the \joption{fsi},
\joption{fsii} or \joption{fsiii} key, respectively (see sec.~\ref{sec:gmacros}).
Alternatively, you can also redefine these macros:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={glosslineone,glosslinetwo,glosslinethree}]
\newcommand*\glosslineone{\normalfont\itshape}% font settings 1st gloss line
\newcommand*\glosslinetwo{\normalfont\upshape}% font settings 2nd gloss line
\newcommand*\glosslinethree{\normalfont\upshape}% font settings 3rd gloss line
\end{lstlisting}
%
The markup of the translation line (if the \jcsmacro{digloss} or \jcsmacro{trigloss}
macro or the \jcsmacro{glot} low-level command is used) can be customized by redefining
the following macro.
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={glosslinetrans,covenquote}]
\newcommand*\glosslinetrans[1]{\covenquote{#1}}
\end{lstlisting}
Note that for \jcsmacro{covenquote}, as used in the default definition, \cvt\ checks at
document begin whether the \textsf{csquotes} \cite{csquotes} package is loaded. If so,
it uses its language-sensitive \jcsmacro{enquote*} macro for enquoting the translation.
If not, a fallback quotation (using English single quotation marks) is used. The usage of
\textsf{csquotes} is highly recommended!

The markup of the preamble line (which is not marked up at all by default) can be customized
by redefining the macro:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={glosslinetrans,covenquote}]
\newcommand*\glosslinepreamble[1]{#1}
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Examples}\label{sec:glossex}

This section gives some further examples. First, a sentence with three lines aligned, 
instead of just two:
\trigloss[fsii={\normalfont\scshape}]
         {Hoc est aliud exemplum}
         {n.sg.nom 3sg n.sg.nom n.sg.nom}
         {This is another example}
         {This is another example.}
In order to produce this, we use the \jcsmacro{trigloss} macro for a three-line gloss
and pass the \joption{fsii} option with the respective font switches in order to
get small capitals in the second line:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={trigloss}]
\trigloss[fsii={\normalfont\scshape}]
         {Hoc est aliud exemplum}
         {n.sg.nom 3sg n.sg.nom n.sg.nom}
         {This is another example}
         {This is another example.}
\end{lstlisting}
%
Next, an example with a gloss but no translation, with an example number 
at the right:
\digloss[tlr]{Hoc habet numerum}
             {This has number}
             {\hfill (\exampleno)}
%
That one was typed using the option \joption{tlr}:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={digloss,exampleno}]
\digloss[tlr]{Hoc habet numerum}
             {This has number}
             {\hfill (\exampleno)}
\end{lstlisting}
%
Third, we'll put a glossed sentence inside the \texttt{example} 
environment, which is a very common way of using it:
\digloss[ex]{Hoc habet numerum praepositum}
            {This has number preposed}
            {This one has a number in front of it.}
This last example was, of course, typed as:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={digloss}]
\digloss[ex]{Hoc habet numerum praepositum}
            {This has number preposed}
            {This one has a number in front of it.}
\end{lstlisting}
although you could also construct it manually as:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={digloss}]
\begin{example}
\digloss{Hoc habet numerum praepositum}
        {This has number preposed}
        {This one has a number in front of it.}
\end{example}
\end{lstlisting}
%
And finally, an example that uses the \emph{Leipzig glossing rules} (\cite{leipzig},
cited example: p.~2) and also exemplifies the use of \joption{preamble}:
\digloss[ex, preamble={Lezgian (Haspelmath 1993:207)}]
            {Gila abur-u-n              ferma hami¨alu\v{g} gü\v{g}üna amuq'-da-\v{c}.}
            {now  they-\textsc{obl-gen} farm  forever       behind     stay-\textsc{fut-neg}}
            {Now their farm will not stay behind forever.}
This has been input as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={digloss},basicstyle={\footnotesize\ttfamily}]
\digloss[ex,preamble={Lezgian (Haspelmath 1993:207)}]
        {Gila abur-u-n              ferma hami¨alu\v{g} gü\v{g}üna amuq'-da-\v{c}.}
        {now  they-\textsc{obl-gen} farm  forever       behind     stay-\textsc{fut-neg}}
        {Now their farm will not stay behind forever.}
\end{lstlisting}
%
Of course, you would use \jfcsmacro{cite} in a real document for the citation.
Also, if you adhere to the \emph{Leipzig glossing rules}, you might want to check out the \textsf{leipzig}
\LaTeX\ package \cite{leipzig-ltx} that facilitates the use of the gloss abbreviations that have
been entered and marked-up manually here.


\section{Phrase structure rules}

To print phrase structure rules such as \psr{S}{NP~VP} you can use \texttt{covington's} macro
\jcsmacro{psr\{\jparam{constituent}\}\{\jparam{sub-constituents}\}} (for the given example,
\lstinline[moretexcs={psr}]"\psr{S}{NP~VP}").

\section{Feature structures}

To print a feature structure such as
\begin{flushleft}
\fs{case:nom \\ person:P}
\end{flushleft}
you can type:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={fs}]
\fs{case:nom \\ person:P}
\end{lstlisting}

The feature structure can appear anywhere --- in continuous text, in a
displayed environment such as \jfenv{flushleft}, or inside a
phrase-structure rule, or even inside another feature structure.

To put a category label at the top of the feature structure, like this,
\begin{flushleft}
\lfs{N}{case:nom \\ person:P}
\end{flushleft}
here's what you type:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={lfs}]
\lfs{N}{case:nom \\ person:P}
\end{lstlisting}
And here is an example of a \textsc{ps}-rule made of labeled feature structures:
\begin{flushleft}
\psr{\lfs{S}{tense:T}}
    {\lfs{NP}{case:nom \\  number:N}
     \lfs{VP}{tense:T \\ number:N} }
\end{flushleft}
which was obviously coded as:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={lfs,psr}]
\psr{\lfs{S}{tense:T}}
    {\lfs{NP}{case:nom \\  number:N}
     \lfs{VP}{tense:T \\ number:N} }
\end{lstlisting}


\section{Discourse Representation Structures}

Several macros in \cvt\ facilitate display of discourse 
Representation Structures (\textsc{drs}es) in the box notation introduced by 
Hans Kamp.  The simplest one is \jcsmacro{drs}, which takes two arguments:
a list of discourse variables joined by \verb"~", and a list of \textsc{drs} 
conditions separated by \verb"\\".  Nesting is permitted.  Note that the 
\jcsmacro{drs} macro itself does not give you a displayed environment; you 
must use \jfenv{flushleft} or the like to display the \textsc{drs}.
Here are some examples:

\begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={drs}]
\begin{flushleft}
  \drs{X}{donkey(X)\\green(X)}
\end{flushleft}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}{.4\textwidth}
\begin{flushleft}
\drs{X}{donkey(X)\\green(X)}
\end{flushleft}
\end{minipage}

\medskip

\begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={drs}]
\begin{flushleft}
  \drs{X}
  {named(X,`Pedro') \\
    \drs{Y}{donkey(Y)\\owns(X,Y)}~~
    {\large $\Rightarrow$}~
    \drs{~}{feeds(X,Y)}
  }
\end{flushleft}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}{.4\textwidth}
	\begin{flushleft}
		\drs{X}
		{named(X,`Pedro') \\
			\drs{Y}{donkey(Y)\\owns(X,Y)}~~
			{\large $\Rightarrow$}~
			\drs{~}{feeds(X,Y)}
		}
	\end{flushleft}
\end{minipage}

\medskip

\noindent To display a sentence above the \textsc{drs}, use \jcsmacro{sdrs}, as in:

\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={sdrs}]
\begin{flushleft}
  \sdrs{A donkey is green.}{X}{donkey(X)\\green(X)}
\end{flushleft}
\end{lstlisting}
which prints as:

\begin{flushleft}
		\sdrs{A donkey is green.}{X}{donkey(X)\\green(X)}
\end{flushleft}

Some \textsc{drs} connectives are also provided (normally for forming
\textsc{drs}es that are to be nested within other \textsc{drs}es).
The macro \jcsmacro{negdrs} forms a \textsc{drs} preceded by a negation symbol:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={negdrs}]
\negdrs{X}{donkey(X)\\green(X)}
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{flushleft}
\negdrs{X}{donkey(X)\\green(X)}
\end{flushleft}
Finally, \jcsmacro{ifdrs} forms a pair of \textsc{drs}es joined by a big arrow,
like this:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={ifdrs}]
\ifdrs{X}{donkey(X)\\hungry(X)}
      {~}{feeds(Pedro,X)}
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{flushleft}
\ifdrs{X}{donkey(X)\\hungry(X)}
      {~}{feeds(Pedro,X)}
\end{flushleft}
If you have an ``if''-structure appearing among ordinary predicates 
inside a \textsc{drs}, you may prefer to use \jcsmacro{alifdrs}, which is just like 
\jcsmacro{ifdrs} but shifted slightly to the left for better alignment.

\section{Exercises}\label{sec:exercises}

The \jenv{exercise} environment (alias \jenv{covexercise}) generates an exercise numbered according 
to chapter, section, and subsection (suitable for use in a large book; 
in this example, the subsection number is going to come out as 0). Here is an example:
\begin{exercise}[Project]
Prove that the above assertion is true.
\end{exercise}
This was coded as
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{exercise}[Project]
Prove that the above assertion is true.
\end{exercise}
\end{lstlisting}
The argument (\verb"[Project]" in the example) is optional.

Note that, as of version 1.1, \cvt\ checks if there is already an \jenv{exercise} environment
defined (e.\,g., by the class). If so, \cvt\ does not define its own one. However, there is always
the alias environment \jenv{covexercise} which can be used in order to produce \texttt{covington's} exercise.
If you use the package option \joption{force}, \cvt\ will override existing \jenv{exercise}
environments. In any case, the package will issue a warning if \jenv{exercise} is already defined.

\section{Reference Lists}\label{sec:reflists}

To type a simple \textsc{lsa}-style hanging-indented reference list, you can use the \jenv{reflist}
environment.  (\emph{Note:} \jenv{reflist} is not integrated with Bib\TeX\ in any way.%
\footnote{For Bib\TeX, there are several options: the \textsc{lsa} style, as used in the journal \emph{Language},
can be obtained by means of the style files \texttt{lsalike.bst}
(\url{http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/ftp/pub/speech/jurafsky/lsalike.bst}) or \texttt{language.bst}
(\url{http://ron.artstein.org/resources/language.bst}); the latter uses \texttt{natbib}.
The so-called \emph{Unified Style Sheet for Linguistics}, as proposed by the \textsc{cel}x\textsc{j}
(\emph{Committee of Editors of Linguistics Journals}), which slightly differs from the \textsc{lsa} style,
is followed by the style file \texttt{unified.bst} (available at \url{http://celxj.org/downloads/unified.bst}).
A \texttt{biblatex} style file for the unified style is available at
\url{https://github.com/semprag/biblatex-sp-unified} or on \textsc{ctan} as part of the \textsf{univie-ling} bundle.})  For example,
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{reflist}
Barton, G. Edward; Berwick, Robert C.; and Ristad, Eric Sven.  1987.
Computational complexity and natural language.  Cambridge, 
Massachusetts: MIT Press.

Chomsky, Noam.  1965.  Aspects of the theory of syntax.  Cambridge,
Massachusetts: MIT Press.

Covington, Michael.  1993.  Natural language processing for Prolog
programmers.  Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall.
\end{reflist}
\end{lstlisting}
prints as:
\begin{reflist}
Barton, G. Edward; Berwick, Robert C.; and Ristad, Eric Sven.  1987.
Computational complexity and natural language.  Cambridge, 
Massachusetts: MIT Press.

Chomsky, Noam.  1965.  Aspects of the theory of syntax.  Cambridge,
Massachusetts: MIT Press.

Covington, Michael A.  1993.  Natural language processing for Prolog 
programmers.  Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall.
\end{reflist}
By default, the references have a hanging indentation of 3\,em. This can
be globally changed by altering the length \jcsmacro{reflistindent}.
Doing \lstinline|\setlength\reflistindent{1.5em}|, for instance,
will shorten the indentation by half. Likewise, the length \jcsmacro{reflistitemsep}
(6\,pt by default) and \jcsmacro{reflistparsep} (ca. 4\,pt by default) can be adjusted
to alter the vertical separation (\jfcsmacro{itemsep} and \jfcsmacro{parsep}, for that
matter) of reference entries.

Notice that within the reference list, ``French spacing'' is in effect 
--- that is, spaces after periods are no wider than normal spaces. Thus 
you do not have to do anything special to avoid excessive space after 
people's initials.


\section{Semantic markup}\label{sec:markup}

The macro \jcsmacro{sentence} displays an italicized sentence (it is a 
combination of \jfenv{flushleft} and \jfmacro{itshape}).  If you type
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={sentence}]
\sentence{This is a sentence.}
\end{lstlisting}
you get:
\sentence{This is a sentence.}
%
The font shape can be modified by redefining the following macro:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={sentencefs}]
\newcommand*\sentencefs{\itshape}
\end{lstlisting}
%
The following macros provide further markup options common in linguistics:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \lstinline[moretexcs={lexp}]|\lexp{word}| is used to mark word forms
	      (italic by default, as in \lexp{word})
	\item \lstinline[moretexcs={lcon}]|\lcon{concept}| is used to mark concepts
	       (small caps by default, as in \lcon{concept})
	\item \lstinline[moretexcs={lmean}]|\lmean{meaning}| is used to mark meaning
	      (single quotes by default, as in \lmean{meaning})
\end{itemize}
%
Note that for \jcsmacro{lmean}, \cvt\ checks at document begin whether the \textsf{csquotes}
\cite{csquotes} package is loaded. If so, it uses its language-sensitive \jcsmacro{enquote*}
macro for quoting. If not, a fallback quotation (using English single quotation marks) is used.
The usage of \textsf{csquotes} is highly recommended!

Here are the definitions of the macros. They can be redefined via \jcsmacro{renewcommand}:
\begin{lstlisting}[moretexcs={providecommand,lexp,lcon,lmean,covenquote}]
\providecommand*\lexp[1]{\textit{#1}}
\providecommand*\lcon[1]{\textsc{#1}}
\providecommand*\lmean[1]{\covenquote{#1}}
\end{lstlisting}
%

\section{Big curly brackets (disjunctions)}

Last of all, the two-argument macro \jcsmacro{either} expresses alternatives
within a sentence or \textsc{ps}-rule:
\begin{flushleft}
\lstinline[moretexcs={either}]"the \either{big}{large} dog" $=$ the \either{big}{large} dog \\
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
\lstinline[moretexcs={either,psr}]"\psr{A}{B~\either{C}{D}~E} " $=$ \psr{A}{B~\either{C}{D}~E}
\end{flushleft}

That's all there is for now.
Suggestions for improving \cvt\ are welcome, and bug
reports are actively solicited (via \url{https://github.com/jspitz/covington}).  Please note, however, that this is free
software, and the authors make no commitment to do any further work on 
it.

	\item Introduce macro \jcsmacro{SetDiaOffset} for more convenient setting of vertical distance
	      in stacked diacritics. See sec.~\ref{sec:accents} for details.
	\item \LaTeX\ 2.09 is no longer officially supported (it might continue to work, but is not
	      tested).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{1.3 (2017 April 5)}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Gloss variants \jcsmacro{xgll} and \jcsmacro{xglll} that work
	      inside macros (such as footnotes) but require explicit gloss
	      line end markers (\jcsmacro{xgle}). See sec.~\ref{sec:gloss} for details.
	\item New lengths \jcsmacro{reflistindent}, \jcsmacro{reflistparsep} and
	      \jcsmacro{reflistitemsep} to globally adjust the indentation or vertical
	      space, respectively, of reflist items.
	      See sec.~\ref{sec:reflists} for details.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{1.2 (2016 August 26)}

\begin{itemize}
	\item New length \jcsmacro{examplenumbersep} to adjust (increase) the horizontal space
	between example number and example text. See sec.~\ref{sec:ex} for details.
	\item Add some more info about bibliography generation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{1.1a (2016 July 7)}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Fix encoding problem in documentation and some typos. No change in functionality.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{1.1 (2016 July 6)}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The package now uses \textsc{nfss} font commands if available (fallback for \LaTeX\ 2.09 is still provided).
	\item Work around clash with classes\slash packages that define their own \jenv{example} and
               \jenv{examples} environments (most notably the \texttt{beamer} class) as well as \jenv{execise} environments.
               The \cvt\ package no longer blindly attempts to define these environments. By default, it does not
               define them if they are already defined (\texttt{covington's} own environments, however, are still available via aliases).
               By means of a new package option, a redefinition can also be forced.  See sec.~\ref{sec:ex} and \ref{sec:exs} for details.
	\item New length \jcsmacro{twoaccsep} allows for the adjustment of the distance between stacked accents (see sec.~\ref{sec:accents}).
	\item Update manual.
	\item New maintainer: J. Spitzm\"uller.
	\item License has been changed to \textsc{lppl} (in agreement with M. Covington)
	\item Introduce version numbers. Arbitrarily, we start with 1.1.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2014 May 16}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Patches by Robin Fairbairns:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Setting of \jfcsmacro{textfloatsep} uses \jfcsmacro{setlength} rather than \jfcsmacro{renewcommand}
		\item Style file converted to un*x line endings
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2001 March 27}

\begin{itemize}
	\item It is no longer necessary to type \jfcsmacro{it} to get proper italic type in feature structures.
	\item Instructions have been rewritten with \LaTeXe\ users in mind.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Older versions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Multiple accents on a single letter (e.\,g., \emph{\acm{a}}) are supported.
	\item This package is now called \cvt\ (with the o)
	and is compatible with \LaTeXe\ and \textsc{nfss} as well as \LaTeX\ 2.09.
	\item The vertical placement of labeled feature structures has 
	been changed
	so that the category labels line up regardless of the size of
	the structures.
\end{itemize}
