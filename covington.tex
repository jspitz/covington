\section*{New in This Version}
\begin{itemize}
\item It is no longer necessary to type \verb"\it" to get proper italic type in feature structures.
\item Instructions have been rewritten with \LaTeXe\ users in mind.
\end{itemize}

\section*{New in Preceding Versions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Multiple accents on a single letter (e.g., \emph{\acm{a}}) are supported.
\item This package is now called {\tt covington} (with the o)
and is compatible with \LaTeXe\ and NFSS as well as \LaTeX\ 2.09.
\item The vertical placement of labeled feature structures has 
been changed
so that the category labels line up regardless of the size of
the structures.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Introduction}
This file, {\tt covington.tex}, is the documentation for the 
March 2001 version of {\tt covington.sty}, which is a \LaTeX\ style 
option for typing many of the special notations common in linguistics.

{\footnotesize 
In em\TeX\ under MS-DOS, {\tt covington.sty} is called {\tt covingto.sty}.
The missing $n$ has no effect.}

To use {\tt covington.sty}, you should have a copy of it in either your
current directory or the directory where \LaTeX\ styles are kept on your 
system.

Then, under \LaTeXe,
include the command
\verb"\usepackage{covington}"
after your \verb"\documentclass" command.

{\footnotesize
In \LaTeX\ 2.09,
include {\tt covington} among the optional parameters of 
\verb"\documentstyle", like this: \hfill\\
{\tt
\verb"\documentstyle[12pt,"\underline{covington}\verb"]{article}"
}\hfill\\
Note the spelling {\tt covington} (9 letters).
}

In what follows I presume that you know how to use \LaTeX\ and have 
access to the \LaTeX\ manual. Note that {\tt covington.sty} does not 
provide any special fonts or character sets.  However, it can be used in 
combination with other style sheets that do.

If you are using {\tt covington.sty} and {\tt uga.sty} (UGa thesis style) 
together, you should mention {\tt uga} before {\tt covington}.

 
\section{Accents}

\LaTeX\ provides a generous range of accents that can be placed on any
letter, such as:
\begin{flushleft}
\`{x} \'{x} \^{x} \"{x} \~{x} \={x} \H{x} \t{xx} \c{x} \d{x} \b{x}
\end{flushleft}
which are typed, respectively, as:
\begin{verbatim}
\`{x} \'{x} \^{x} \"{x} \~{x} \={x} \H{x} \t{xx} \c{x} \d{x} \b{x}
\end{verbatim}
\LaTeX also provides the foreign characters
\begin{flushleft}\obeyspaces
\i \j \ae \AE \oe \OE \aa \AA \o \O \l \L \ss ?` !`
\end{flushleft}
which are typed as:
\begin{verbatim}
\i \j \ae \AE \oe \OE \aa \AA \o \O \l \L \ss ?` !`
\end{verbatim}

But by itself, \LaTeX\ doesn't give you a convenient way to put two
accents on the same letter.  To fill this gap, {\tt covington.sty} provides
the following macros:
\begin{flushleft}
\verb,\twoacc[...|...], \quad to combine any 2 accents, e.g.,
               \verb.\twoacc[\~|\={a}]. = \twoacc[\~|\={a}]\\[6pt]
\verb,\acm{...}, \quad for acute over macron, e.g., \verb.\acm{a}. = \acm{a}\\
\verb,\grm{...}, \quad for grave over macron, e.g., \verb.\grm{a}. = \grm{a}\\
\verb,\cim{...}, \quad for circumflex over macron, e.g., \verb.\cim{a}. = \cim{a}
\end{flushleft}
The first of these is the general case and the latter three are special
cases that occur often in transcribing Greek.  Now you can type
\emph{Koin\acm{e}} with both accents in place.

Note the peculiar syntax of \verb.\twoacc. --- its arguments are in
square brackets, not curly brackets, and are separated by \verb.|..
The first argument is the upper accent (only) and the second argument
is the letter with the lower accent indicated.

Note also that not all accents work in the {\tt tabbing} environment.
Use {\tt tabular} or see the \LaTeX\ manual for workarounds.

\section{Example numbers}

Linguistics papers often include numbered examples.
The macro \verb"\exampleno" generates a new example number and can be 
used anywhere you want the number to appear.  For example, to display a 
sentence with a number at the extreme right, do this:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{flushleft}
This is a sentence. \hfill (\exampleno)
\end{flushleft}
\end{verbatim}
Here's what you get:
\begin{flushleft}
This is a sentence. \hfill (\exampleno)
\end{flushleft}
The example counter is actually the same as \LaTeX's equation counter, 
so that if you use equations and numbered examples in the same
paper, you get a single continuous series of numbers. If you want to 
access the number without changing it, use \verb"\theequation".

Also, you can use \verb"\label" and \verb"\ref" with example numbers in 
exactly the same way as with equation numbers.  See the \LaTeX\ manual for
details. This applies to the {\tt example} and {\tt examples} 
environments, described next, as well as to \verb"\exampleno" itself.

\section{The {\tt example} environment}

The {\tt example} environment displays a single example
with a generated example number to the left of it.
If you type
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{example}
This is a sentence.
\end{example}
\end{verbatim}
you get:
\begin{example}
This is a sentence.
\end{example}
The {\tt example} environment is a lot like {\tt flushleft}. The example
can be of any length; it can consist of many lines (separated by \verb"\\"),
or even whole paragraphs.

One way to number sub--examples is to use {\tt itemize} or {\tt 
enumerate} within an example, like this:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{example}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] This is the first sentence.
\item[(b)] This is the second sentence.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}
\end{verbatim}
This prints as:
\begin{example}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] This is the first sentence.
\item[(b)] This is the second sentence.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}
However, the {\tt examples} environment, described next, is usually more 
convenient.

\section{The {\tt examples} environment}

To display a series of examples together, each with its own example 
number, use {\tt examples} instead of {\tt example}.  The only 
difference is that there can be more than one example, and each of them 
has to be introduced by \verb"\item", like this:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{examples}
\item This is the first sentence.
\item This is the second sentence.
\end{examples}
\end{verbatim}
This prints as:
\begin{examples}
\item This is the first sentence.
\item This is the second sentence.
\end{examples}


\section{Glossing sentences word--by--word}

To gloss a sentence is to annotate it word--by--word.  Most commonly, a 
sentence in a foreign language is followed by a word--for--word 
translation (with the words lined up vertically) and then a smooth 
translation (not lined up), like this:%
\footnote{The macros for handling glosses are adapted with permission 
from {\tt gloss.tex}, by Marcel R. van der Goot.}
\gll Dit is een Nederlands voorbeeld. 
     This is a Dutch example. 
\glt `This is an example in Dutch.'
\glend
That particular example would be typed as:
\begin{verbatim}
\gll Dit is een Nederlands voorbeeld. 
     This is a Dutch example. 
\glt `This is an example in Dutch.'
\glend
\end{verbatim}
Notice that the words do not have to be typed lining up; instead, \TeX\ 
counts them.  If the words in the two languages do not correspond 
one--to--one, you can use curly brackets to show the intended grouping.
For example, to print
\gll Dit is een voorbeeldje     in het Nederlands.
     This is a {little example} in {}  Dutch.
\glt `This is a little example in Dutch.'
\glend
you would type:
\begin{verbatim}
\gll Dit is een voorbeeldje     in het Nederlands.
     This is a {little example} in {}  Dutch.
\glt `This is a little example in Dutch.'
\glend
\end{verbatim}
All together, {\tt covington.sty} gives you five macros for dealing with
glosses:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb"\gll" introduces two lines of words vertically aligned, and 
activates an environment very similar to {\tt flushleft}.
\item \verb"\glll" is like \verb"gll" except that it introduces {\em 
three} lines of lined--up words (useful for cited forms, morphology,
and translation).
\item \verb"\glt" ends the set of lined--up lines and introduces a line 
(or more) of translation.
\item \verb"\gln" is like \verb"\glt" but does not start a new line 
(useful when no translation follows but you want to put a number on the 
right).
\item \verb"\glend" ends the special {\tt flushleft}--like environment.
\end{itemize}
Here are several examples.  First, a sentence with three lines aligned, 
instead of just two:
\glll  Hoc est aliud exemplum.
       n.sg.nom 3.sg n.sg.nom n.sg.nom
       This is another example.
\glt   `This is another example.'
\glend
This is typed as:
\begin{verbatim}
\glll  Hoc est aliud exemplum.
       n.sg.nom 3.sg n.sg.nom n.sg.nom
       This is another example.
\glt   `This is another example.'
\glend
\end{verbatim}
Next, an example with a gloss but no translation, with an example number 
at the right:
\gll  Hoc habet numerum.
      This has number
\gln  \hfill (\exampleno)
\glend
That one was typed as:
\begin{verbatim}
\gll  Hoc habet numerum.
      This has number
\gln  \hfill (\exampleno)
\glend
\end{verbatim}
Finally we'll put a glossed sentence inside the {\tt example} 
environment, which is a very common way of using it:
\begin{example}
\gll  Hoc habet numerum praepositum.
      This has number preposed
\glt  `This one has a number in front of it.'
\glend
\end{example}
This last example was, of course, typed as:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{example}
\gll  Hoc habet numerum praepositum.
      This has number preposed
\glt  `This one has a number in front of it.'
\glend
\end{example}
\end{verbatim}
Notice that every glossed sentence begins with either \verb"\gll" or 
\verb"\glll", then contains either \verb"\glt" or \verb"\gln", and ends 
with \verb"\glend".  Layout is critical in the part preceding 
\verb"\glt" or \verb"\gln", and fairly free afterward.

\section{Phrase structure rules}

To print the phrase structure rule \psr{S}{NP~VP} you can type
\verb"\psr{S}{NP~VP}", and likewise for other phrase structure rules.

\section{Feature structures}

To print a feature structure such as:
\begin{flushleft}
%\fs{\it case:nom \\ \it person:P}
\fs{case:nom}
\end{flushleft}
you can type:
\begin{verbatim}
\fs{case:nom \\ person:P}
\end{verbatim}

The feature structure can appear anywhere --- in continuous text, in a
displayed environment such as {\tt flushleft}, or inside a
phrase--structure rule, or even inside another feature structure.

To put a category label at the top of the feature structure, like this,
\begin{flushleft}
\lfs{N}{case:nom \\ person:P}
\end{flushleft}
here's what you type:
\begin{verbatim}
\lfs{N}{case:nom \\ person:P}
\end{verbatim}
And here is an example of a PS--rule made of labeled feature structures:
\begin{flushleft}
\psr{\lfs{S}{tense:T}}
    {\lfs{NP}{case:nom \\  number:N}
     \lfs{VP}{tense:T \\ number:N} }
\end{flushleft}
which was of course typed as:
\begin{verbatim}
\psr{\lfs{S}{tense:T}}
    {\lfs{NP}{case:nom \\  number:N}
     \lfs{VP}{tense:T \\ number:N} }
\end{verbatim}


\section{Discourse representation structures}

Several macros in {\tt covington.sty} facilitate display of discourse 
repsesentation structures (DRSes) in the box notation originally used by 
Hans Kamp.  The simplest is \verb"\drs", which takes two arguments:
a list of discourse variables joined by \verb"~", and a list of DRS 
conditions separated by \verb"\\".  Nesting is permitted.  Note that the 
\verb"\drs" macro itself does not give you a displayed environment; you 
must use {\tt flushleft} or the like to display the DRS.
Here are some examples:
\begin{verbatim}
\drs{X}{donkey(X)\\green(X)}
\end{verbatim}
\begin{flushleft}
\drs{X}{donkey(X)\\green(X)}
\end{flushleft}
\begin{verbatim}
\drs{X}
{named(X,`Pedro') \\
\drs{Y}{donkey(Y)\\owns(X,Y)}~~
       {\large $\Rightarrow$}~
        \drs{~}{feeds(X,Y)}
}
\end{verbatim}
\begin{flushleft}
\drs{X}
{named(X,`Pedro') \\
\drs{Y}{donkey(Y)\\owns(X,Y)}~~
       {\large $\Rightarrow$}~
        \drs{~}{feeds(X,Y)}
}
\end{flushleft}
To display a sentence above the DRS, use \verb"\sdrs", like this:
\begin{verbatim}
\sdrs{A donkey is green.}{X}{donkey(X)\\green(X)}
\end{verbatim}
\begin{flushleft}
\sdrs{A donkey is green.}{X}{donkey(X)\\green(X)}
\end{flushleft}
Some DRS connectives are also provided (normally for forming
DRSes that are to be nested within other DRSes).
The macro \verb"\negdrs" forms a DRS preceded by a negation symbol:
\begin{verbatim}
\negdrs{X}{donkey(X)\\green(X)}
\end{verbatim}
\begin{flushleft}
\negdrs{X}{donkey(X)\\green(X)}
\end{flushleft}
Finally, \verb"\ifdrs" forms a pair of DRSes joined by a big arrow,
like this:
\begin{verbatim}
\ifdrs{X}{donkey(X)\\hungry(X)}
      {~}{feeds(Pedro,X)}
\end{verbatim}
\begin{flushleft}
\ifdrs{X}{donkey(X)\\hungry(X)}
      {~}{feeds(Pedro,X)}
\end{flushleft}
If you have an ``if''--structure appearing among ordinary predicates 
inside a DRS, you may prefer to use \verb"\alifdrs", which is just like 
\verb"\ifdrs" but shifted slightly to the left for better alignment.

\section{Exercises}

The {\tt exercise} environment generates an exercise numbered according 
to chapter, section, and subsection (suitable for use in a large book; 
in this example, the subsection number is going to come out as 0).
\begin{exercise}[Project]
Prove that the above assertion is true.
\end{exercise}
This was typed as
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{exercise}[Project]
Prove that the above assertion is true.
\end{exercise}
\end{verbatim}
and the argument \verb"[Project]" is optional (actually, any word could 
go there).

\section{Reference Lists}

To type an LSA--style hanging--indented reference list, use the {\tt 
reflist} environment.  ({\em Note:\/} {\tt reflist} is not presently
integrated with Bib\TeX\ in any way.)  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{reflist}
Barton, G. Edward; Berwick, Robert C.; and Ristad, Eric Sven.  1987.
Computational complexity and natural language.  Cambridge, 
Massachusetts: MIT Press.

Chomsky, Noam.  1965.  Aspects of the theory of syntax.  Cambridge,
Massachusetts: MIT Press.

Covington, Michael.  1993.  Natural language processing for Prolog
programmers.  Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice--Hall.
\end{reflist}
\end{verbatim}
prints as:
\begin{reflist}
Barton, G. Edward; Berwick, Robert C.; and Ristad, Eric Sven.  1987.
Computational complexity and natural language.  Cambridge, 
Massachusetts: MIT Press.

Chomsky, Noam.  1965.  Aspects of the theory of syntax.  Cambridge,
Massachusetts: MIT Press.

Covington, Michael A.  1993.  Natural--language processing for Prolog 
programmers.  Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice--Hall.
\end{reflist}
Notice that within the reference list, ``French spacing'' is in effect 
--- that is, spaces after periods are no wider than normal spaces. Thus 
you do not have to do anything special to avoid excessive space after 
people's initials.


\section{Displayed sentences}

The macro \verb"\sentence" displays an italicized sentence (it is a 
combination of {\tt flushleft} and \verb"\em").  If you type
\begin{verbatim}
\sentence{This is a sentence.}
\end{verbatim}
you get:
\sentence{This is a sentence.}


\section{Big curly brackets (disjunctions)}

Last of all, the 2--argument macro \verb"\either" expresses alternatives
within a sentence or PS--rule:
\begin{flushleft}
\verb"the \either{big}{large} dog" $=$ the \either{big}{large} dog \\
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
\verb"\psr{A}{B~\either{C}{D}~E} " $=$ \psr{A}{B~\either{C}{D}~E}
\end{flushleft}

That's all there is.
Suggestions for improving {\tt covington.sty} are welcome, and bug
reports are actively solicited.  Please note, however, that this is free
software, and the author makes no commitment to do any further work on 
it.
